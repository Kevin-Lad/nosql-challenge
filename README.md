# nosql-challenge
Description:
This is the homework challenge for module 12 of bootcamp, which focuses on NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB. The setting for the challenge is that I have been contracted by a food magazine to evaulate the ratings data that was put out by the UK Food Standards Agency. The purpose of the evalutions is to help the magazine's journalists and food critics decide where to focus their articles.

The first part of the challenge is to upload the JSON file into the notebook. Once uploaded, I confirm that it was done correctly.

The second part of the assignment is to update the database with new information. Some of the data that was added was incomplete or in an incorrect format, my code corrects those issues.

Analyzing the data is the final part of the challenge. There are several queries here that provide information for the magazine. The results from the queries are then converted into dataframes.

Code:
A starter code was provided for this assignment. I used the lessons we learned in class to build the rest of code.
